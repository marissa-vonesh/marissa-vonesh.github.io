Below are examples of my work from <strong>Distraction Magazine</strong>, <strong>University of Miami</strong>, <strong>5280 Magazine</strong> and <strong>Smithsonian Magazine</strong>.

				          <p class="source"><strong>Our National Parks</strong>, 2018</p>
				          <p>There is a slight buzz hanging in the dirt baked, humid South Florida air. A group of students, uniform in Miami Shores Elementary t-shirts and the remnants of their lunch crusted on their lips, blend into the nature. It is not a common sight. Across the United States, the National Park Service has struggled to attract diverse, young visitors, especially as demographics shift, an issue that has influenced the understanding of the parks and preservation efforts.<a href="http://www.ournationalparks.us/south_florida/everglades/everglades-works-on-diversity-dilemma/"> Read more here.</a></p>

				          <p>Not everybody wants a Valentine, not yet anyway. Marriage and the desire to get married continues to be influenced by changing socioeconomic and cultural factors. Increasingly, young, educated adults are pushing back marriage dates and questioning what marriage even is.<a href="http://www.distractionmagazine.com/i-do-but-not-yet-if-ever/"> Read more here.</a></p>

				          <p>The 25-year-old Leonard Bernstein had spent the morning scrambling to prepare for what he believed should not have happened for years. It was November 14, 1943, and Bernstein had gotten the call informing him he was to step in that night for the famous conductor Bruno Walter at Carnegie Hall, who was ailing. Bernstein rushed to visit the famous conductor. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/moment-defins-famed-american-composer-leonard-bernstein-180970027/">Read more here.</a></p>

				          <p>It might seem unlikely that a man raised in the mountains of the West and a woman from India would ever cross paths. Yet, in Mountains Made for Us - the premiere production from Roshni, an Aurora-based nonprofit arts organization - the marrying of these two divergent cultures highlights an important lesson about appreciating tradition but still following your heart. <a href="https://www.5280.com/2019/08/a-contemporary-american-bollywood-love-story-comes-to-aurora/"> Read more here. </a> </p>

She stumbles back, grabbing her face. <a href="http://www.distractionmagazine.com/the-invisible-trade/">Read more here. </a></p>
