    <p>Hi! My name is Marissa and I am a senior at the University of Miami. I hail from the mountains of Northern Arizona and I am pursuing degrees in Journalism and History. I've tried to make the most of my time at the university by getting involved on campus and studying abroad.</p>

    <p>For example, up until this year I have been a part of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Student Government</li>
      <li>Distraction Magazine</li>
      <li>Residential Life</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And after studying abroad for a year I visited:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Czech Republic</li>
      <li>Croatia</li>
      <li>Poland</li>
      <li>South Africa</li>
      <li>Mozambique</li>
      <li>Swaziland</li>
    </ul>
