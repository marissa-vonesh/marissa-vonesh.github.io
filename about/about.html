								<p>As a recent graduate of the University of Miami, I have years of experience working for the university’s student lifestyle magazine, <strong>Distraction,</strong> having served as both the editor-in-chief and art director. I’ve had stints fact-checking, researching, writing and curating newsletters for <strong>Smithsonian Magazine</strong> and <strong>5280 Magazine,</strong> developing the brand identity and marketing materials for <strong>Amy Foundation,</strong> a non-profit in Cape Town, and concepting advertising campaigns and producing creative content for various clients (such as University of Miami’s Herbert Business School and the NCAA) while working for a student-run creative consultancy, <strong>Orange Umbrella.</strong> I like having my hands in all different pots, working in collaborative, team-oriented environments and using dance breaks as a method of stress relief. I am a creative, a storyteller, a designer and a writer.</p>
